Two weeks ago was a whirlwind of events, taking me from the conforting embrace of Amman, Jordan to the vibrant streets of Newcastle, England. It was a journey filled with highs and lows, professional achievements, and personal challenges.

## The Journey Begins

It all started on a Monday morning in Amman as I embarked on a journey to attend a Quality Control (QC) conference in Newcastle. The anticipation of presenting my work at an international forum filled me with excitement and nerves. The conference was scheduled for just one day, but the impact it had on me would last much longer.

## A Successful Presentation

Tuesday arrived, and with it came the day of the conference. Armed with a PowerPoint presentation comprising over 130 slides, I delved into four hours of intense presenting. Despite the pressure, the conference was a resounding success. My project received positive feedback, and I felt a sense of accomplishment as I shared my work with colleagues from around the world.

## The Toll of Travel

However, as I returned to Amman on Wednesday, I couldn't shake off a sense of exhaustion. Little did I know that the toll of travel would soon manifest itself in a most unexpected manner. 

Thursday morning greeted me with heavy flu-like symptoms. It hit me like a ton of bricks. The combination of jet lag, long hours of presenting, and exposure to new environments had taken its toll on my immune system. I was bedridden, grappling with a chesty cough that seemed relentless.

## The Show Must Go On

Despite my illness, there was no time for rest. The following week demanded my presence at a site meeting where I was tasked with condensing my extensive slide deck into a concise presentation of just 12 slides. The challenge was daunting, but I tackled it with determination.

## Reflecting on the Journey

As I look back on the rollercoaster week that was, I'm struck by the juxtaposition of success and struggle. From the heights of presenting at an international conference to the lows of battling illness, it was a journey that tested my resilience and resolve.

But through it all, one thing remains clear: adversity only serves to make us stronger. Each obstacle we overcome, whether professional or personal, contributes to our growth and development.

So here's to the rollercoaster weeks, the ones filled with ups and downs, twists and turns. For it is in those moments of challenge that we discover the true extent of our capabilities.

As I upload this blog post using Hugo, I do so with a renewed sense of gratitude for the journey and all it has taught me. Here's to embracing the ride, wherever it may take us.
